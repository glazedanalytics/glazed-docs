## Prerequisites

Before importing your Figma files, ensure you have:

- **Read access** to the Figma file you want to import
- **Share settings configured** - Enable "Viewers can copy, save, and export" in your Figma file's share settings

## Steps to Import

### 1. Create a New Glazed Project

1. Log into your Glazed account
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Give your project a descriptive name

### 2. Import Your Figma File

1. In your Glazed project, click "Import Figma File"
2. Copy the Figma project or page link from your browser
3. Paste the link into Glazed
4. Click "Import"

## Important Considerations

### Performance Guidelines

- **Large files**: Files with 100+ screens may reduce performance
- Consider breaking large files into smaller, focused imports
- Focus on key user flows and high-priority screens first

### Alternative Import Method

For websites that need to be tracked, you can use the **"html.to.design" Figma plugin** to import websites directly into Figma, then import them into Glazed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Access denied**: Ensure you have read access to the Figma file
- **Import fails**: Check that share settings allow copying and exporting
- **Missing screens**: Verify you're copying the correct project/page URL

### Tips for Success

- Organize your Figma files with clear naming conventions
- Group related screens and flows together
- Ensure all necessary assets are included in the file

## Next Steps

Once your Figma file is imported, you can proceed to [Import Tracking Schema](import-tracking-schema.md) to connect your analytics events.
