# Glazed Plugin for Figma

Streamline your tracking implementation with the Glazed companion plugin. Access your event documentation from Figma screens without ever leaving the Figma canvas.

## Overview

Turn your Figma designs into visual tracking plans and handover your analytics events directly in Figma. The Glazed Plugin bridges the gap between design and implementation, making analytics tracking more visual and intuitive.

## ü§ñ How the AI Workflow Works

### 1. Create and link events with AI
Upload your design file into Glazed and get instant event suggestions already linked to design components. Our AI analyzes your interface and suggests relevant tracking events based on common interaction patterns and best practices.

### 2. Perfect developer handoff
Use this plugin to see exactly which UI elements trigger what events. No more guessing or translating between design mockups and tracking specifications.
