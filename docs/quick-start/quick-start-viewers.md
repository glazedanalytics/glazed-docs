# Quick Start Guide for Glazed Viewers

If you're a developer or only looking to find event names, this is the right guide for you.

## Say Goodby to Spreadsheets

Glazed replaces tracking spreadsheets with a visual-first Figma-integrated process that sits on top of your existing workflow.

### Canvas View

Like Figma but for tracking documentation. Here is our Canvas Cheat Sheet for an overview of the different navigation actions:

**Key Canvas Actions:**

- **Filter events in screen only** by selecting the name of the screen
- **Filter events by status** by clicking a status on the left navbar
- **Display children of event** by clicking on `x2` on left navbar
- **Swap between events and screens** by clicking on their name in the right navbar.
- **Open page/screen view event** by clicking on frame name in canvas or via the left navbar
- **Display all events in canvas** via user profile > show events in canvas
