## ðŸ¤– How the AI Workflow Works

### 1. Create and link events with AI

Upload your design file into Glazed and get instant event suggestions already linked to design components. Our AI analyzes your interface and suggests relevant tracking events based on common interaction patterns and best practices.

### 2. Perfect developer handoff

Use this plugin to see exactly which UI elements trigger what events. No more guessing or translating between design mockups and tracking specifications.
