# Glazed Analytics Documentation

Create visual tracking plans that connect your Figma designs directly to analytics events. No more disconnect between design mockups and tracking implementation.

## Quick Start

**New to Glazed?** Start with our [5-minute Quick Start](quick-start/quick-start-guide.md) to import your first Figma file and create events.

**Need help understanding the basics?** Check out [Key Concepts](quick-start/key-concepts.md) to learn how Glazed works.

## What is Glazed?

Glazed bridges the gap between design and analytics by letting you:

- **Import Figma files** and visually map tracking events to UI elements
- **Generate tracking specifications** that developers can implement directly
- **Use AI suggestions** to automatically create relevant events for your designs
- **Maintain consistency** across your entire analytics implementation

## How it Works

1. **Import your Figma designs** into Glazed
2. **Click on UI elements** (buttons, forms, links) to assign tracking events  
3. **Export implementation specs** for your development team
4. **Use the Figma plugin** for seamless design-to-code handoffs
